      <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">I chose RMIT because the university is located close to where I live. RMIT is also known for being a good university for technology. The course I’m doing is flexible that offers both IT courses and other electives that I can choose in areas that interest me which is business and technology.  RMIT also has a good international reputation and local reputation.I expect to learn basics about information technology and computer science while also learning how to think. I also expect to learn about a wide range of subjects. I expect to learn about IT and technology while also growing as a person while transitioning to adulthood.

</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">I would say I don’t have a specific interest in IT, but I do like the application of IT to the real world and how IT can be used in different industries. I do enjoy analyzing and interpreting data in a business setting. I have always been interested in IT from a young age with using technology such as computers, laptops, phones, tablets and video games. Partly of why I am interested in IT is because its an emerging market and most likely jobs will be around. Last year in year 12 is when I started to really think to do this as a career, due to me doing informatics where we focused a lot on IT work, I really enjoyed it. I did work with databases and had a project where I had to come up with a hypothesis and prove it or disprove it. My hypothesis was that if a sugar tax will help with obesity and up prices, I created a website to show it which was very fun.</p>

      <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This is a business analyst job; a business analyst job is a job where a person analyses business system and finds problems or deficiencies with the systems and comes up with solutions to these problems. Specifically, this job is at a communication company which helps provide easier ways for different industries to communicate with each other. The job involves helping improve old communication applications that they use while also helping to design and developing new applications. Also if you take a look at some of the responsibilities for this job, they really interest me as far as analyzing trends and communicating them in a meaningful way. This is appealing to me because it is in the CBD and inner suburbs which is a big plus for me as it is close to where I live. It is also appealing because the company works with firefighters and police officers which I consider very important jobs for my community so anything that can help them will be of great importance in keeping my community safer. Another appealing aspect is that I will be working with a lot of different people such as engineers and developers which I can also learn a lot from.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">The skill requirements involve excellent communication skills both written and verbal. The position also requires an attention to detail and time management. I will also have to be able to use some tools and services such as Confluence and JIRA which I’m not familiar with. Some other skill requirements involve interpersonal skills and an ability to conduct interviews. The experience requirements are an experience with analysis and software development approaches.
I would say that I possess good communication skills both written and verbal but not amazing. I would say I have a poor attention to detail and time management, but I would also like to also improve that. I think I possess basic interpersonal skills although I am a bit reserved and quiet. Other than those I don’t possess any of the other skills and experience to do this job as of right now.
My communication skills will be greatly improved through my time at university due to specifically my IT tutorials because of all our group discussions while also in my other classes becoming more outspoken and presenting my work to the class and articulating myself. As for my written communication skills, these will also be improved due to assignments and lectures. For example, take this assignment I am writing right now this will greatly improve my written communication skills.  My attention to detail and time management will have to greatly improve if I want to do this job as I am very easily distracted and leave things to the last minute. My biggest distraction would have to be my phone which is hard to get rid of. I plan to minimize my screen time on my phone by adopting some new hobbies such as reading which can also help me improve my communication skills.

<h1>IT Project</h1>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The project that I would like to do would be a password manager which would help manage all your passwords and important information. Personally, using the same password for everything can be dangerous because once someone knows that password it can be very hard to gain back control of it. Also having so many usernames and passwords it’s hard to keep track of all of them and this would be perfect to store all your passwords. The password manager would also help with creating new passwords for different logins and help make your passwords become stronger and harder to hack into by hackers or someone you know. </p>
                             <p class="w3-text-grey">This will be a very useful project because anyone who uses the internet or computer will have to deal with passwords. Elderly people and kids have a hard time remembering things such as passwords and this can be perfect for them. Another key target audience could be business people because they have important documents on documents therefore, they must use long and unique passwords to protect their information so they may use this app. The market for this application is endless because passwords are used in everyday life by people and why do they use passwords? Because they want their information safe so why would they not use a password manager application. Basically, this password manager would take the hassle out of remembering long and strong passwords, while also having your passwords at your fingertips.</p>
                                                 <p class="w3-text-grey">First the app will be a free app to download and will have to be an app that people sign up for. First you will have to sign up with your email and give a password. This will be to confirm you are who you say you are, and, in the future, we can use your email to verify who you are and send an email if someone is trying to access your password manager. After signing in you will have to have a password to get into the application, preferably the password will long and be a mix of lower and upper case and would also recommend writing that password down just in case, although the password will be backed up on your email. A feature that would be good to do would to if the password is entered wrongly, your phone takes a picture without alerting the person trying to get into the application. Once in the application there will be a list of categories of accounts you can save your passwords in such as Facebook or bank account. Once you enter your password and username if you want to as well, the app will analyze your password and see if its strong by analyzing the length and the mix of uppercase and lowercase words with numbers included. The settings will also allow you to have a wide range of security approaches such as a self-destruct button that will get rid of all the data in the app. There will also be a backup option of all your passwords just to take every precaution possible. In the settings I will also have a folder full of the login times for the app to indicate to the user if someone has secretly got into the application and is using it without your knowledge because most likely the only way someone could get a hold of your passwords, is that they physically got into your phone. Another feature I would have is a random password generator that would generate a password that is a least 8 characters long with numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters and symbols, this would help the user with coming up with passwords. The application would also have a secret list for passwords that you would like to have an extra layer of security on so even if someone gets into the application physically, they will have a hard time getting your important information. I would have fingerprint login only if you the user wants it because of course biometrics is the strongest password because only that specific user can access it although it is only relegated to the iPhone that has a fingerprint scanner and of course it wont always work but it is the best way to verify the user. Although I plan to have all these features in the application due to my limited knowledge it may be hard to implement all these features into the application such as the fingerprint scanner, at the end of day if the application is safe to use and does what it is intended to do than I would consider it a good application.</p>
                                                                         <p class="w3-text-grey">I could also use tools such as MIT app inventor to create the application. There is a whole host of different software out there that I can use to make this app. For example, there is a mobile application development framework called Apache Cordova which is a system software that can help me create this password manager application. Other technologies that will be needed are a laptop to write all the code in. The Cordova software will allow me to create all aspects of the application such as the home screen and the access screen which I can design to make it look attractive to the users.</p>
                                                                                                <p class="w3-text-grey">Skills needed will have to be an expertise in a programming language. Recently I have been learning to code using java which I could use to help when writing the program for the password manager application. Another skill that will be needed is encryption skills which is converting information into a code so an unauthorized party may not see it and only the authorized party who has a key to read the code can see it. This skill will be needed because there is sensitive information stored in the application and I don’t want unauthorized external forces to access the information.</p>
                                                                                                                        <p class="w3-text-grey">If the project is successful, the outcome will be a very top of the line password managing application that will be easy to use. It will be both cost effective and high quality. The original problem of people forgetting their usernames and passwords will be solved. This development could have a great impact because everyone should be using a password manager application to keep track of all passwords that they use. The great thing about it as well is that your passwords are never that far away from you, so if there is an emergency you can access it anywhere and anytime on your phone.</p>
