      <p class="w3-text-grey">I would say I don’t have a specific interest in IT, but I do like the application of IT to the real world and how IT can be used in different industries. I do enjoy analyzing and interpreting data in a business setting. I have always been interested in IT from a young age with using technology such as computers, laptops, phones, tablets and video games. Partly of why I am interested in IT is because its an emerging market and most likely jobs will be around. Last year in year 12 is when I started to really think to do this as a career, due to me doing informatics where we focused a lot on IT work, I really enjoyed it. I did work with databases and had a project where I had to come up with a hypothesis and prove it or disprove it. My hypothesis was that if a sugar tax will help with obesity and up prices, I created a website to show it which was very fun.</p>

      <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This is a business analyst job; a business analyst job is a job where a person analyses business system and finds problems or deficiencies with the systems and comes up with solutions to these problems. Specifically, this job is at a communication company which helps provide easier ways for different industries to communicate with each other. The job involves helping improve old communication applications that they use while also helping to design and developing new applications. Also if you take a look at some of the responsibilities for this job, they really interest me as far as analyzing trends and communicating them in a meaningful way. This is appealing to me because it is in the CBD and inner suburbs which is a big plus for me as it is close to where I live. It is also appealing because the company works with firefighters and police officers which I consider very important jobs for my community so anything that can help them will be of great importance in keeping my community safer. Another appealing aspect is that I will be working with a lot of different people such as engineers and developers which I can also learn a lot from.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">The skill requirements involve excellent communication skills both written and verbal. The position also requires an attention to detail and time management. I will also have to be able to use some tools and services such as Confluence and JIRA which I’m not familiar with. Some other skill requirements involve interpersonal skills and an ability to conduct interviews. The experience requirements are an experience with analysis and software development approaches.
I would say that I possess good communication skills both written and verbal but not amazing. I would say I have a poor attention to detail and time management, but I would also like to also improve that. I think I possess basic interpersonal skills although I am a bit reserved and quiet. Other than those I don’t possess any of the other skills and experience to do this job as of right now.
My communication skills will be greatly improved through my time at university due to specifically my IT tutorials because of all our group discussions while also in my other classes becoming more outspoken and presenting my work to the class and articulating myself. As for my written communication skills, these will also be improved due to assignments and lectures. For example, take this assignment I am writing right now this will greatly improve my written communication skills.  My attention to detail and time management will have to greatly improve if I want to do this job as I am very easily distracted and leave things to the last minute. My biggest distraction would have to be my phone which is hard to get rid of. I plan to minimize my screen time on my phone by adopting some new hobbies such as reading which can also help me improve my communication skills.
